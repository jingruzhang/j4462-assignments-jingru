The first project I chose is from NPR Visuals: "A Silent Epidemic: The Mental Health Crisis In Our Schools". 

The first reason why I chose it is: It's interesting to learn how the app looks like on the website and how it looks like in the programming language. 

The app looks really simple running on the website. However, when I looked at the repository I realized it used multiple languages: python, javascript, S3, etc. It is a bit intimidating to see a simple project requires knowledge of all these languages and tools.  

Since we are learning python in this class, I opened a few .py files to see how they worked. 

It's very clear when NPR team wrote the app, they had someones (who probably have more experience coding) wrote comments to outline tasks and to explain things to pay attention to. This is the first step, and the real coding came second after planning. Because of all the comments, it's easier for me to follow despite my minimum knowledge of the language. 

My question for this project is how they incorporate media files into the codes.

Another interesting project that NPR Visuals did is a web-scrapping analysis of the website: armslist.com. The codes look a lot simpler this time, in only one language, python. But it has a lot to do with data analysis and data visualization. This project is probably closer to what we will do for this class. It makes me feel really excited about my class projects! 

My question for this project is how they put the location on a map and visualized it.
